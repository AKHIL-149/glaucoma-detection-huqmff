
Intended Use – H-UQ-MFF Glaucoma Screening System
-------------------------------------------------
The H-UQ-MFF model is intended as a clinical decision-support tool for
screening of referable glaucoma from color fundus photographs in adults
(>=18 years) in primary care and ophthalmology screening settings.

The system is NOT a stand-alone diagnostic device. Final diagnostic and
treatment decisions MUST remain with a qualified eye-care professional.
High-uncertainty (U>0.50) and low-quality images must be routed for
manual review.
